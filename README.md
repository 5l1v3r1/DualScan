# DualScan

## What is DualScan?
DualScan is a tool to launch nmap tcp and udp scans in parallel on a single command line

## What is useful for?
Well, the idea came to my mind scanning some ctf boxes but works for everything. It performs Syn and Udp pingless scans with default NSE nmap scripts and a default timing.

## How to use it?
* sudo python3 DualScan.py -t xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx -o myreport  
* go for coffee :)

## Do I need anything?
Only nmap is requeried. No extra imports needed
